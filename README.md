# ProcRuntime
Command line utility to check how fast programs are running. it's probably very inaccurate. It tries to be os compatable, but is not.

usage: `ProcRuntime.exe -c 1000 -o runtimelog.txt app.exe`

compile: `c++ ./Main.cpp -o ./ProcRuntime.exe` also probably wont work, you can grab yourself a windows copy on the releases page.
